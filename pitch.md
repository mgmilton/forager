### Pitch

1-3 sentences that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

- The main purpose of this application is to allow for communities to track free food sources. For instance, in Portland there are a lot of wild mushrooms and fig trees. This application will allow users to log the location of these spots. Additionally, users will be able to log a plant photo to ask for help with identification.

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

- There's a lot of food waste and simultaneously there's a lot of hunger in this country. Additionally, a lot of cities have food deserts where fresh food is unavailable.


### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

- This application will allow users to track fresh food and thereby making that food more accessible. Perhaps if people are shown where fresh food is they'll utilize it as a resource more regularly?


### MVP

What is your MVP? Be very specific about what pieces of functionality will be in place.

* Must have MVP: An application where users can log food locations on a map.

* Hope to reach (beyond my initial MVP): An application where users can log photos associated with the food locations on a map. Ideally, a call to some API whose endpoints provide plant data.


### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

- Hungry people in cities.

### New Technologies

Which new technologies will you implement?

- I'm hoping to utilize some JQuery, a non-relational database, and Sidekiq/background workers. I potentailly might try doing this in another framework, too.

### User Stories

You must have at least 5 of the first user stories for you app up on your board in order for this to be approved. We recommend referencing the user stories provided in Quantified Self for great examples.
